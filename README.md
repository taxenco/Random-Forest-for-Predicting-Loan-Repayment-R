# Random Forest for Predicting Loan Repayment

The project consists of Predicting Loan Repayments using the Random Forest Supervised Learning algorithm. The Random forest uses an ensemble learning method for regression and the bagging technique. The trees in random forests are run in parallel. There is no interaction between these trees while building the trees.
